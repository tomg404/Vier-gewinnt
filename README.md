# Vier gewinnt / Four connects
The game itself is pretty self explaining I think.

**Disclaimer:**
Sometimes the algorithm which checks if somebody has won doesn't work. I will
fix this someday.

## Install and run
- Install the requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Run:
```
python3 run.py
```

- Get verbose output:
```
python3 run.py -v
```

- Prevent colored output:
```
python3 run.py -nc
```
